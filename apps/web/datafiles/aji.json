  "introduction": "Spanish mackerel is an inexpensive fish like other shiny fishes, however it is one of the tastiest, and healthiest fish. The word aji is phonetically identical to the word “taste” in Japanese, and is believed to bare its name for a good taste, and was a popular fish for the lower class for its affordable price. It is a small fish that can only create 2~6 pieces of sushi. The Spanish mackerel family is distinct for having a unique zipper like scale (zeigo) that runs along its long side.",
